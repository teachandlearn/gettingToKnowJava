# gettingToKnowJava
This is where I will be keeping my projects that I make as I learn Java. 

Why do I want to learn Java:
1. The more I learn languages with different ways of programming, the better I get at teaching the major concepts of programming.
2. I am learning Java so that I can write apps for my Android phone. 
3. I am continuing to research lessons and ideas for teaching programming to middle schoolers.
